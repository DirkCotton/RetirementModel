# Earnings Limit
# If you are under full retirement age you are limited to $16,920 in wages or net earnings from self employment. If you exceed that limit, your benefit will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you go over. The one exception is the calendar year you turn full retirement age. For that period, your limit is a much higher $44,880. The amount theyâ€™ll reduce your benefit by is more generous as well.
# Once you are full retirement age, there is no limit to the amount you can earn while drawing Social Security.
